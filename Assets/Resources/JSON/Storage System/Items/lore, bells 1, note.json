  "body": "Stay home where you are safe, me and your father are more than enough to go out and look for food or clothes. Always remember to keep everything locked and stay quiet whenever you hear anything nearby or those church bells ringing again, even if you hear them to be far away or even if you don’t, but can feel their vibrations under your feet, please stay put, just stay put, things will turn out alright.\n\nStreet St. Abelard usually has the fewest people and the most filled supermarket shelves, it’s a shame that beautiful side of town had to be destroyed by the avalanche of leftover debris, I felt the world had lost an arm and a leg when I found the central park again, that within its golden gardens we’ve worked on so intensely as a community, its marbled wonders and brush-painted memoirs... They’re safer now in our hearts and memory. I regret not taking more family photos during our weekends there. The enamel carving tributed to grandfather wasn’t luckier, you might now realize why we’ve put a “bag of stones” on your bed that sad day.\n\nI’m sorry we came home without saying another word then, seeing father’s statue reduced to pebbles... Mom wouldn't want you to see her face then.",
